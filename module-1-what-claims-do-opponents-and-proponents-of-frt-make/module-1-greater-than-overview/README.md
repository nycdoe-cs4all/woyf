# Module 1 -> Overview

### Module Overview

This module has two main goals: to hook students' interest in facial recognition technology (FRT) and to expose students to a variety of texts that present both positive and negative impacts of the technology as they read about and watch videos that discuss benefits and harms of FRT. Students will be encouraged to take note of claims that author's make in support or opposition of the technology and keep track of those in their evidence tracker, which they will later refer to as they write their opening statements for the SPAR debate at the end of Module 2. &#x20;

### Nota Bene

You know your students best and while we have made a significant effort to provide you with robust resources in this unit, it is likely that you will have students who require further differentiation.&#x20;
