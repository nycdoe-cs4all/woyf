### Lesson Overview

In this lesson, students learn how to make use of the evidence tracker worksheet to keep track of claims and evidence they encounter in various texts they read across modules. Students should be encouraged to gather a diversity of claims, so they are prepared to argue and counter-argue different positions. Students will closely read excerpts from (or the entire) article above to identify and take note of claims and evidence in support of and those in opposition to facial recognition technology.

### Nota Bene

The skills you focus on in this lesson will largely depend on your students' needs. Some possibilities include: appropriate citation; academic language for citing claims and evidence; annotation skills; articulating reasoning to explain how evidence supports a claim and so on. Similarly, the instructional strategy you elect to use for the reading activity will also depend largely on your audience. Some suggested approaches are shared below.&#x20;

### Objectives

Students will be able to...

* closely read a complex text.
* engage in collaborative discussion about a text.
* identify claims and related evidence in a complex text.

### Suggested Duration

45 minutes (adjust according to your students' needs)

### &#x20;NYS Next Generation ELA Standards

* **R1** Cite strong and thorough textual evidence to support analysis of what the text says explicitly/ implicitly and make logical inferences; develop questions for deeper understanding and for further exploration.
* **SL1**: Initiate and participate effectively in a range of collaborative discussions with diverse partners on complex topics, texts, and issues; express ideas clearly and persuasively, and build on those of others.

### NYS Computer Science & Digital Fluency Standards

* **9-12.IC.1** Evaluate the impact of computing technologies on equity, access, and influence in a global society.

### Vocabulary

Remind students to take note of and use the vocabulary terms that were highlighted yesterday as they read and discuss today's text.&#x20;

### Hook

Invite students to take out their T-chart from yesterday's lesson and take a minute or two to review their notes with the following questions in mind:&#x20;

* Are most of your notes in either the pro or con column? Or do you have about the same number of examples on either side?&#x20;
* At this point, what's your gut feeling about the following statement: The benefits of FRT outweigh the risks?

Give students two to three minutes to discuss the above with a partner or in small table groups.

### Mini-Lesson

Interactively preview the text with students; highlight (or elicit from students) that typically claims and evidence are not so clearly marked as 'pro' or 'con' and that this text presents an overview of key arguments about FRT. Strategically choose an excerpt or two from the text to read aloud to the class while modeling the use of the evidence tracker. It is recommended that you assign the evidence tracker to each student in Google Classroom to ensure that they do not lose track of it. They will be adding to and referring to this document throughout the unit. Let them know this!

### Activity

Based on your population and their needs, choose an instructional strategy for students to closely read the text. Some options include: teacher/ para led small group guided reading; strategically grouping students in pairs or small groups (no more than 4); independent reading; or jigsaw reading, to name a few.&#x20;

Whichever approach you choose, be intentional about ensuring students access a balance of claims and evidence, so that they are getting exposure to both arguments in support of FRT and those in opposition to it. &#x20;

### Wrap-Up

Bring the class back together to share the claims that they found most compelling or interesting. Elicit any original examples that students might have, i.e., examples not found in the text. Create a pro/ con anchor chart that takes note of the examples they have collected from the reading along with any additional ideas shared in the whole class discussion.
