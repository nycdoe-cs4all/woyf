# Module 3 -> Overview

### Module Overview

Up to this point, students' arguments have likely been focused on the impacts of FRT as it is applied due to the resources they have been provided. In this module, students are presented with texts that explore how FRT works, how/when/why it doesn't work properly. We begin by understanding, in simple terms, what an algorithm is and then move on to how machines learn. Students learn about algorithmic bias and Joy Buolamwini's Incoding movement and, choosing from a menu of options, develop an artifact that urges their community to learn about FRT. Students who are motivated to dive deeper are offered a rich repository of recommended reading. With this exposure to how FRT works, students will be empowered to write technical claims to support their position.&#x20;
