### Lesson Overview

In this lesson, students continue to engage in the scenario-based activity presented in Module 4 that has them working as research interns for the Electronic Frontiers Foundation. In this lesson, students learn about current legislation in NYC that regulates businesses deployment of biometric technologies but does not apply to government agencies. They watch a 20 minute investigative report from CNBC called "The Fight Over Police Use of Facial Recognition Technology" and take note of the key issues flaming that controversy. Students complete an activity guide with questions based on information and ideas presented in the news report. Time permitting, students have the opportunity to read the current NYC law, which is linked in the Activity Guide.

### Nota Bene

As mentioned above, the video used in this lesson is quite long. Use your best teacher judgement to determine how you want to pace the viewing and the degree to which you want to support students in answering the questions in the activity guide.&#x20;

### Objectives

Students will be able to...

* Evaluate current local legislation regulating biometric technologies.&#x20;
* Take note of common themes in conversations about FRT in policing
* Explain how regulation of FRT might influence the reach and impact of the technology as it used in policing.

### Suggested Duration

45 minutes (adjust according to your students' needs)

### NYS Next Generation ELA Standards

* **W1c:**  Use precise language and content-specific vocabulary to express the appropriate complexity of the topic.
* **RH9:** Compare and contrast treatments of the same topic in several primary and secondary sources.
* **R1** Cite strong and thorough textual evidence to support analysis of what the text says explicitly/ implicitly and make logical inferences; develop questions for deeper understanding and for further exploration.

### NYS Computer Science & Digital Fluency Standards

* **9-12.IC.5**  Describe ways that complex computer systems can be designed for inclusivity and to mitigate unintended consequences.
* **9-12.IC.3** Debate issues of ethics related to real world computing technologies.
* **9-12.IC.1** Evaluate the impact of computing technologies on equity, access, and influence in a global society.

### Hook

Present this summary of NYC Local Law 3, which went into effect in July 2021 and prompt students to writing in their notebooks: What do you notice? What do you wonder? What are some questions you have?&#x20;

After facilitating a whole class discussion in response to the warm-up prompt, present the food for thought slide. Let students know that during this module, they will continue thinking about the role of governance and regulation in ensuring that the rights of the public are protected.&#x20;

### Mini-Lesson

Present the review slides to provide the context for the video that students are going to watch. Remember, the video is 20 full minutes, so based on the length of your class, be sure to keep track of pacing.&#x20;

Let student know: In our last module, we considered whether the NYPD FRT Impact & Use Guidelines are a sufficient protection against potential risks and abuses of FRT when used for policing.

Whether or not FRT should be used in policing is a major controversy across the United States. We are going to closely watch and listen to an investigative news report about the issue and actively take notes in todayâ€™s [activity guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/16b38jy69mudHBT2862ae3lASpElJuhSuR6lL2qTblE0/copy).\


### Activity

Provide students with the purpose for viewing: **What are the key issues driving the controversy about FRT being used in policing?**&#x20;

Screen the video "The Fight Over Police Use of Facial Recognition Technology" and pause strategically to check for comprehension. According to your particular students' needs, determine whether to engage in collaborative writing in response to the video-based questions in the activity guide or if you will screen the video first and give them to respond in writing afterward. If you opt for the latter, consider facilitating a processing conversation with the class. Here are some potential prompts:

* What are the key issues driving the controversy about whether FRT should be used in policing?
* Who are some of the main entities participating in this conversation?
* What recommendations would YOU make to NYC council about FRT & policing?

Students work on answering the video-based questions in the activity guide.

### Wrap Up

Check in with students to get a sense of their progress. If the majority of the class is ready to move on, let students know that tomorrow they are going to continue carrying out research that will empower them to bring recommendations to City Council related to FRT and policing in NYC.
