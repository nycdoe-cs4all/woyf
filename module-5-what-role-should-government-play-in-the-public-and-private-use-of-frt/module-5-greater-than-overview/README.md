# Module 5 -> Overview



### Module Overview

In this final module, students train their focus on issues of governance, regulation, and civic engagement as it relates to the deployment of FRT. Students grapple with the essential question, "To what extent are we governed by technology?", by reflecting on all the research and learning they have done up to this point in addition to delving into texts focused on the how and why of regulations. Importantly, students will be preparing to educated their community about the benefits and risks of FRT in the end of unit project and are expected to approach the conversation from a solutions-oriented mindset. Students should be urged to dig into nuance, middle ground, and healthy compromises.
