### Module Overview

This module assumes that students have previous knowledge of and experience with the SPAR debate protocol. This module gives students an opportunity to deepen their proficiency with SPAR debates by: challenging them to argue a different position; evaluating their claims and evidence to ensure alignment; track the distribution of evidence collected using their self-designed research tracker. Students should be encouraged to be attentive to both affirmative and negative claims and evidence as they closely read texts about FRT applications in different contexts and to lean into nuance--what might constitute a middle ground argument?&#x20;

### Nota Bene

Starting in Module 2, you will see a new Confirm or Challenge prompt at the top of each lesson. These are debatable prompts that can be used for SPAR debates that students argue in favor of (the affirmative) or opposition to (negative).

Depending on your students' needs, you can assign all four of the texts or allow students to select which two they will read. The texts are curated to include different perspectives, so if you opt to have students read two texts only, have them choose one from each of the following pairs: _Facial Recognition is Improving Customer Experience while Enhancing Security_ OR T_op Ten Face Recognition Apps_; and _Madison Square Garden Uses Facial Recognition to Ban its Owner's Enemies_ OR _New Trends May Help TikTok Collect Your Personal, Unchangeable Biometric Identifiers_. Of course, as students prepare for their first SPAR debate in this unit, they should also be making reference to the claims and evidence they took note of in module 1.
