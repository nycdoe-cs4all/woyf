### Lesson Overview

In this lesson, students will have continued opportunity to closely read the text and to focus on differentiating between claims, evidence and reasoning. There is a particular focus on verifying whether evidence aligns to a particular claim--which is the focus of the mini-lesson. Students continue their close reading of the article paying special attention to whether the evidence they have identified aligns to the claim. Try, if at all possible, to allocate some time for students to begin refining their opening statement from last week with claims, evidence and reasoning they have gathered from this weeks reading.&#x20;

### Nota Bene

Keep this mini-lesson short so students have ample time to finish closely reading and gathering evidence from their respective versions of the text to record in their Evidence Trackers. It is highly recommended that you allocate-if at all possible-the last ten minutes of class as time for working on incorporating claims, evidence and reasoning students have gathered so far in this module into their opening arguments.

### Objectives

* closely read a complex text.
* verify that evidence identified to support a given claim aligns to that claim.
* explain to a partner how evidence does or does not align to a claim.

### Suggested Duration

45 minutes (adjust according to your students' needs)

### Next Generation ELA Standards

* closely read a complex text.
* verify that evidence identified to support a given claim aligns to that claim.
* Use specific academic language to explain why/ how the identified evidence supports the given claim.

### NYS Computer Science & Digital Fluency Standards

* **9-12.IC.1** Evaluate the impact of computing technologies on equity, access, and influence in a global society.
* **9-12.IC.3** Debate issues of ethics related to real world computing technologies.
* **9-12.IC.5**  Describe ways that complex computer systems can be designed for inclusivity and to mitigate unintended consequences.
* **9-12.DL.1:** Type proficiently on a keyboard.
* **9-12.DL.2:** Communicate and work collaboratively with others using digital tools to support individual learning and contribute to the learning of others.

### Hook

Provide the given claim from lesson 3 and evidence from the anchor text that supports that claim \[see slide deck]. Ask students to write a sentence or two that explains how/ why the evidence supports the given claim. Provide a sentence frame and word bank for students in need of language support.&#x20;

### Mini-Lesson

Present students will examples of the given claim and different excerpts from the text. Unpack why and how each excerpt is or is not aligned to claim. Elicit from students some ideas about what kind of claim would this evidence support? See slide deck for examples. All example come from the anchor text to further students exposure with the added support of this guided lesson.&#x20;

### Activity

Students are strategically assigned in pair groups. Students should first return to the evidence they identified in Lesson 3 and verify whether it aligns to the given claim. If not, students should make this misalignment more salient for themselves by explaining to their partner why it does not align. Once partners complete their review of the evidence they have gathered, students can do one of the following, depending on their specific needs:&#x20;

1. continue their close reading of their respective version of the anchor text paying special attention to whether the evidence they are selecting aligns to the given claim.&#x20;
2. begin to work on integrating the claims, evidence and reasoning they have aggregated into their SPAR opening statement.&#x20;

### Wrap Up

Depending on where your students are in this process, you can do a quick wrap up showing students how they will incorporate these new claims, evidence and reasoning into their SPAR opening statements and give them some time to start on that.
