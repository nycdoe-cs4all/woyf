### Lesson Overview

Today's the big day! Students have another opportunity to engage in SPAR debates, this time with a lot more schema about the SPAR protocol and the topic of FRT. It is recommended that you continue with the adjusted schedule \[presented in the slide decks] and adjust the time needed for writing counter arguments and closing statements based on your students' needs. Be sure to allocate time for the SPAR reflection.

### Nota Bene

This will be a fast-paced period--especially when it comes time to draft counter-arguments. Be mindful of timing and plan in advance how you will support students in need. However, all students should feel challenged and the goal is not perfection. As above, according to your setting, students will likely benefit from an adjusted debate schedule that _shortens_ the duration of the opening statement from 3 minutes to ninety seconds and expands the time for drafting counter-arguments from 6 minutes to ten.

### Objectives

Students will be able to...

* present claims, evidence and reasoning within the SPAR format;
* actively listen and take note of opponents' claims, evidence & reasoning;
* draft and present counter-arguments to their opponents' argument.

### Suggested Duration

45 minutes (adjust according to your students' needs)

### Next Generation ELA Standards

* **W1c:**  Use precise language and content-specific vocabulary to express the appropriate complexity of the topic.
* **WHST1**: Write arguments based on discipline-specific content.
* **SL4**: Present claims, findings, and supporting evidence clearly, concisely, and logically; organization, development, substance, and style are appropriate to task, purpose, and audience.
* **SL1a**: Come to discussions prepared, having read and researched material under study; draw on that preparation by referring to evidence to stimulate a thoughtful, well-reasoned exchange of ideas.

### NYS Computer Science & Digital Fluency Standards

* **9-12.IC.5**  Describe ways that complex computer systems can be designed for inclusivity and to mitigate unintended consequences.
* **9-12.IC.3** Debate issues of ethics related to real world computing technologies.
* **9-12.IC.1** Evaluate the impact of computing technologies on equity, access, and influence in a global society.
* **9-12.DL.1:** Type proficiently on a keyboard.
* **9-12.DL.2:** Communicate and work collaboratively with others using digital tools to support individual learning and contribute to the learning of others.

### Vocabulary

### Hook

Briefly overview the format of the SPAR debate and get students set up with all the requisite materials: their prepared opening statements, the counter-argument builder handout, and the reflection handout.  Remind students that you will be keeping very close track of time and that even if they are mid-sentence when the time is called, the need to stop. ðŸ˜¬ Similarly, if there is still time remaining and a team has finished their statement they must WAIT before proceeding. (This is much more common during the first few SPAR debates).

### Mini-Lesson

Remind students that you will be keeping very close track of time and that even if they are mid-sentence when the time is called, the need to stop. ðŸ˜¬ Similarly, if there is still time remaining and a team has finished their statement they must WAIT before proceeding. (This is much more common during the first few SPAR debates). Give students FIVE minutes to practice their opening statements and study their notes.

### Activity

Once students have completed their second SPAR debate, congratulate them and share some observations you made while circulating throughout the room. Let students know that next week, they will work on making technical claims about FRT and produce a cool art project.&#x20;

### Wrap Up

Students complete the SPAR reflection--try to give at least five minutes but preferably ten.
